alphasAi Healthcare System
This project consists of two main modules:

Chatbot for Healthcare Queries
Skin Disease Classification System
Requirements
Libraries
The following Python libraries are required for running the project:

nltk (Natural Language Toolkit for text processing)
numpy (Numerical operations)
tensorflow (For loading and using pre-trained models)
pickle (For loading serialized data)
tkinter (For building GUI interface)
PIL (For image processing and display)
You can install the necessary libraries using the following pip commands:

Copy code
pip install nltk numpy tensorflow pillow scikit-learn
Files
Ensure the following files are available in the appropriate directory:

Chatbot:

model.h5 (Pre-trained model for chatbot)
words.pkl (List of words used for chatbot's predictions)
classes.pkl (List of intents or response categories)
intents.json (Contains the intents and responses for chatbot)
Skin Disease Classification:

skin_disease_model.h5 (Pre-trained model for skin disease classification)
logo.jpg (Logo image for the application interface)
Main Functionalities
Chatbot for Healthcare Queries:
The chatbot processes text input and predicts the intent using the chatbot_model.
Responds based on the intent prediction using the responses defined in intents.json.
The chatbot uses a GUI to interact with the user.
Skin Disease Classification:
Upload an image of a skin condition, and the model predicts the disease using the skin_model.
The predicted disease and the confidence level are displayed in the GUI.
How to Use
Running the Program:

Make sure the required libraries are installed.
Place all the necessary files (models and data) in the correct paths as mentioned above.
Execute the program and the GUI will launch.
Chatbot Functionality:

Enter a healthcare-related query into the text input field.
Click Send to get a response from the chatbot.
Skin Disease Classification:

Click the Upload Image button to choose an image of a skin condition.
The model will classify the skin disease and show the predicted result along with confidence.
Clearing Chat Window:

To clear the chat window, click the Clear button.
